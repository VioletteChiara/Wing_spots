This program can be used to measure the size, precise location, and shape characteristics of spot patterns on butterflies wings from the genus _Maculinea_.
For now, it needs pictures of the wings and a TPS file with approximative coordinates of the spots of interest as inputs.

More information will be provided once the associated research article will be published.
